*Workshop from <a href="https://ghw.mlh.io/events/data-week">MLH's GHW - Data Week</a>*

Using <a href="https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started">Go</a> we made our program to mimick payment functionality, including the order struct, payment processor, inventory managment, reduce stock. 

Adding in a file with unit test cases for any possible failures the program could encounter during its execution. 

Such as: 
* invalid orders
* invalid order quantity
* invalid inventory reduction error
